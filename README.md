## Assembling the dataset

- `get_data.ipynb` does the work
- `data` stores the results
- `fix_nonunique_ids.ipynb` was a workaround because, with some (very few) ids, the api call will tell you its a different id

## Running experiments

- `results` holds the (wait for it...) results!
- `supervised_experiments.ipynb` compares some supervised models
- `variance` compares and plots variance for the supervised models tested in `supervised_experiments.ipynb`

## Analysis

- `analysis.ipynb` contains some early analysis of results
- `generating_plots.ipynb` holds the result plotting and optimisation code

## Data
